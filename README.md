# UsefulScripts by Komeran
This repository is a collection of useful C# scripts for Space Engineers! Usage tutorials might be added in the future (Maybe even YouTube videos) but for now try to find out yourself how to use them as I am a rather busy person :D (school and stuff...)

## Current Scripts:
* <b>AirtightDoorScript:</b> To make two doors (can be any kind of doors) behave like an airlock
* <b>ConnectorPanelScript:</b> Just for fancy visuals...
* <b>CoordsScript:</b> To display current world coordinates of a PGB on an LCD screen
* <b>SpeedScript:</b> To display current speed of a PGB on an LCD screen
* <b>SupplyScript:</b> To display some useful supply information on an LCD screen

## Work in progress:
* <b>AntennaScript:</b> Currently messing around with antenna API to find out what useful stuff can be done within a script
* <b>MouseAimedTurretsScript:</b> Thinking of aiming a group of turrets at once using a Remote Control Block. Also I want to make it possible to remotely aim turret groups of many different ships at a target specified by a camera/antenna. Just like <a href="https://youtu.be/GTjZITteKvw?t=3m20s">here</a> just with space engineers laser antennas or camera blocks and WAY more accuracy :D

## Planned Scripts:
None yet. I'm open for suggestions! But please make sure, your ideas don't already exist in the SpaceEngineers Steam workshop before suggesting them to me.

## About Komeran:
Hey there guys! I'm a 20 y.o. game dev from austria! I enjoy playing games like Space Engineers and figured that the programming API makes space (pun intended ;D) for so much opportunities! :D That's why I decided to create this repository as a collection of all the scripts I came up with to improve my personal space engineers experience! :D

<b><i>Feel free to use any of these scripts in your space engineers games/servers but if you share them with others or take code parts for your own scripts please make sure to give some credit to me. It helps me keeping track of how many people find my scripts useful for their own gaming experience :)</b></i>
